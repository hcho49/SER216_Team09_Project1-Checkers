                Play Checkers - User Guide
               ************************************

Checker is a game played by two people. In this game, you can either play with another human or with the computer player.

Starting a New Game:
You can simply start a new game by pressing �New Game� button.

Playing the Game:
Checkers may be moved only diagonally, one square at a time, but cannot be moved backward. A checker may not move to a square occupied by the opponent, but may jump over the opponent's piece to the vacant square immediately beyond the opponent's piece. The leaped-over piece is �taken� and removed from the board. If an opponent's piece is in front of the new position, with an empty space beyond, the second piece may also be taken; this is called a double jump. Longer jumps also occur. Capturing opponent�s checkers is also not possible in backward direction. When a piece on either side has progressed to the last row on the opposite side, it is crowned�that is, made a "king". Crowned checkers are indicated with an additional �star�. Like other pieces, kings can move only diagonally, one square at a time, except when jumping opponent's checkers; however, kings may move either backward or forward and can capture opponent�s checkers in either direction. If you have a chance of capturing an opponent�s checker, you cannot move another checker just ignoring that.

Game Modes:
You can play with computer by selecting �1-player� mode. If you want to play with another human, you have to select "2-player" mode. 

Colours:
I �1-player� mode you can select either �yellow� or �red�. In both modes �yellow� checkers have to be moved first.

Difficulty Levels:
There are 5 difficulty levels available in �1-player� mode. If you are a novice to the game, recommended difficulty level is below �Normal�.

 Undo:
�Undo� function is available in both modes. You can go back one step by pressing �Undo� button. In �1-player� mode, if you have selected difficulty level �Master�, �undo� function is not available.

Winning the Game:
In order to win the game, you want to capture all opponent�s checkers. Winning is also possible when your opponent's checker cannot be move any more.

Good Luck!
